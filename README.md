This is a git repostory for the UMD CS4531 EPA Trashmapping application.  This will allow users to take pictures of trash they see, and it will appear on a map for others to view  

The Android Studio version last used is 2.2.2

#To run the application:
1. You must have both Android Studio and node installed on our machine.
2. To start the node server, run "node index.js" in the Node directory of the project
3. In the HttpAsyncTask class, you must change the address field at the bottom to your local IP address or server address. ie: http://192.168.1.1:4321
