*To run the application:
**You must have both Android Studio and node installed on our machine.
**To start the node server, run "node index.js" in the Node directory of the project
**In the HttpAsyncTask class, you must change the address field at the bottom to your local IP address or server address. ie: http://192.168.1.1:4321
